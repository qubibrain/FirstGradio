# FirstGradio - Gradio Learning Project

This project is created to learn and experiment with Gradio, a Python library for creating customizable web interfaces for machine learning models.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn Gradio fundamentals and best practices
- Experiment with different types of Gradio interfaces
- Build interactive demos for machine learning models
- Understand how to deploy Gradio applications

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FirstGradio
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To run a Gradio app:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:7860` by default.
